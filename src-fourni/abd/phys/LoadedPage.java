/** Encapsulates a buffer that allows to access a page loaded in memory.
 * A loaded page is obtained from {@link SystemLoadedPagesManager#loadPage(String, int, boolean)} or {@link SystemLoadedPagesManager#loadAsNewPage(String, int, boolean)}
 * The byte buffer should be always accessed through the {@link #getByteBuffer()} method, and <b>should not be assigned</b> to a variable and reused through this variable after releasing the loaded page.
 * This is because the buffer can be wrapped over a memory location that might be reused by another page after this loaded page is released.
